# rmdig-ai
Flask app for supporting the rmdig.ai full-stack web interface. Primary interfaces are for exploring the datasets collected by Rocky Mountain Digerati (RMDig) and some of the tools developed and supported by them. A dynamic calendar is also embedded to showcase events sponsored by us.

⚠️ This tool is designed to process data **client-side** or on a private server. Do not upload sensitive or protected data unless you comply with local data use policies.
